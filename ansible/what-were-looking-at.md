in this file is going to be all the ansible stuff that I am going to start creating. 
(first off what if we hosted gitlab...)

anyway 

- playbooks
  - playbook number 1
  - playbook number 2
  - and so on
- inventory
  - inventory file 
  - some explanation file

I think that is a good place to start. lets get that finished first.

the ansible extention is freaking out because ... git dosent have ansible installed...
